# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## üìå Introduction

Welcome to the **Requirement Analysis Project** ‚Äì a key step in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This repository is dedicated to understanding and documenting the requirement analysis phase for a **Booking Management System**.

The goal is to simulate a real-world development scenario by analyzing, structuring, and presenting both functional and non-functional requirements. This includes use case diagrams, user stories, and clearly defined acceptance criteria. The project emphasizes **clarity**, **structure**, and **alignment with user needs**, laying the foundation for scalable and successful software development.

This repository contains all the artifacts and documentation created during the requirement analysis phase.
## üîç What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of users and stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented. It serves as the foundation upon which the entire system is designed and developed.

During this phase, developers and analysts work together to understand what the software must do (functional requirements) and how it should perform (non-functional requirements). The goal is to transform vague ideas into clear, actionable, and measurable requirements.

This step helps identify project scope, avoid misunderstandings, prevent scope creep, and ensure the final product meets user needs. Effective requirement analysis leads to better project planning, cost estimation, risk mitigation, and ultimately, a successful software solution.

In essence, it sets the blueprint for building software that is both technically sound and aligned with user goals.
## ‚úÖ Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a vital role in the success of any software project. Here are three key reasons why it is essential in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

### 1. Prevents Miscommunication and Misalignment
By clearly documenting stakeholder needs and expectations, Requirement Analysis ensures everyone involved‚Äîfrom developers to clients‚Äîhas a shared understanding of the project's goals and scope.

### 2. Improves Planning and Cost Estimation
A well-done requirement analysis helps teams estimate time, resources, and cost more accurately, reducing the chances of unexpected delays or budget overruns.

### 3. Reduces Rework and Enhances Quality
By identifying and clarifying requirements early, development teams avoid costly changes later. This leads to building the right product from the start and improves overall software quality.

Requirement Analysis helps bridge the gap between what users want and what developers build, setting the stage for project success.
