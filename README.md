# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

Welcome to the **Requirement Analysis Project** â€“ a key step in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This repository is dedicated to understanding and documenting the requirement analysis phase for a **Booking Management System**.

The goal is to simulate a real-world development scenario by analyzing, structuring, and presenting both functional and non-functional requirements. This includes use case diagrams, user stories, and clearly defined acceptance criteria. The project emphasizes **clarity**, **structure**, and **alignment with user needs**, laying the foundation for scalable and successful software development.

This repository contains all the artifacts and documentation created during the requirement analysis phase.
